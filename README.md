## Overview
Our sponsor, Cpt. Brian Harder of the Virginia Army National Guard, is charged with the administration of the Holistic Health and Fitness Screening Assessment across Virginia. This comprehensive assessment is vital in ensuring that all soldiers maintain prime mental and physical health, providing them with tailored feedback to meet their diverse needs.

In our endeavor to aid Cpt. Brian and his staff, our team has crafted a web application that simplifies the entire process. The app facilitates the efficient assessment and tracking of soldiers' results on the Holistic Health and Fitness Screening Assessment. It enables soldiers to easily complete the assessment online, thus allowing Cpt. Brian's team to perform in-depth data analytics to pinpoint and assist those in need.

Leveraging the robustness of NodeJS and the reliability of MySQL databases, our technology stack is designed to consolidate assessment data into a single repository. Our goal is to empower our sponsor and his team to analyze the results effectively, gauge the wellness of soldiers in different units, and provide necessary aid wherever it's needed.
